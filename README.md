# Lab 1
Download a benchmark dataset relevant to your assigned domain and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the same. Through EDA explore the nature of your dataset.
And by examining the results of EDA draw the conclusion what type of techniques are suitable for your dataset.

# Lab 2 
Implement any of the supervised machine learning algorithm that follows non-parametric approach for classification on your chosen domain and highlight the main key points of your observation with proper inference.

# Lab 3
Compare and Contrast single regression with multiple regression and provide a detailed observation regarding the working of models with proper inference.

# Lab 4
Program is related to dimensionality reduction. With suitable dataset explore the working of PCA and LDA and identify the differences in the working procedures of both the techniques. Provide sufficient inference based on your understanding and observations.
