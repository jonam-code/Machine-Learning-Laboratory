# Machine-Learning-Laboratory

# Lab 1
Download a benchmark dataset relevant to your assigned domain and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the same. Through EDA explore the nature of your dataset.
And by examining the results of EDA draw the conclusion what type of techniques are suitable for your dataset.

# Lab 2 
Implement any of the supervised machine learning algorithm that follows non-parametric approach for classification on your chosen domain and highlight the main key points of your observation with proper inference.

# Lab 3
Compare and Contrast single regression with multiple regression and provide a detailed observation regarding the working of models with proper inference.

# Lab 4
Program is related to dimensionality reduction. With suitable dataset explore the working of PCA and LDA and identify the differences in the working procedures of both the techniques. Provide sufficient inference based on your understanding and observations.

# Lab 5 - 6
Create a program to implement ANN, SVM and Logistic regression for binary classification using respective datasets related to your own doamin. Find out the inference related to following:
      1. Time complexity
      2.Generalizing capacity of each technique
      3. Hyper parameter tuning and 
      4. Advantages and disadvantages of each technique
NOTE: Prepare a detailed report on comparative study.

# Lab 7 - 8
This weeks lab task is on experimenting with Support Vector Machine. Implement both SVC and SVR to perform classification and regression task on your assigned domain. Check the impact of learning rate and kernels on the model's performance

# Lab 9
Implement KNN classier and experiment with the following concepts

Check the performance of KNN with different distance measures
Check the performance of KNN with binary, categorical & numerical data

# Lab 10
